# Clock App Description
This Clock App is built using Flutter and offers a complete set of time-related functionalities.
It includes four main screens: Digital Clock, Analog Clock, Timer, and Stopwatch. 
The app also features dynamic backgrounds for the Digital and Analog Clock screens, which change according to the time of day to enhance the user experience.

# Features
## Digital Clock
Displays the current time in a digital format (HH:MM
).

The background color dynamically changes based on the time of day:

Morning: Soft, warm tones to represent sunrise.

Afternoon: Bright, vibrant colors to represent daylight.

Evening: Cooler, muted tones for dusk.

Night: Darker shades to represent nighttime.

## Analog Clock

Displays the current time with traditional clock hands.

The background dynamically changes based on the time of day, similar to the Digital Clock:

Morning: Soft, warm tones for a sunrise effect.

Afternoon: Bright, vibrant colors to mimic daylight.

Evening: Cooler, muted tones to represent the setting sun.

Night: Darker shades to indicate nightfall.

## Timer

A simple and user-friendly timer that allows you to set a countdown.
Includes start, pause, and reset functionalities.

## Stopwatch

A fully functional stopwatch with start, pause, and reset buttons.
Allows you to track elapsed time with precision.

### Implementation Details
Dynamic Background: The Digital and Analog Clock screens implement a feature where the background color changes depending on the time of day. This is done by detecting the current time and applying different color schemes that match morning, afternoon, evening, and night.


## Flutter Framework: 
The app is developed entirely using Flutter, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Screenshots
Provide screenshots of the four screens (Digital Clock, Analog Clock, Timer, and Stopwatch) to give users a visual understanding of the appâ€™s interface.
